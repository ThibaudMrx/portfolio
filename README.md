# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases some of the work I’ve done, including coding projects, design elements, and other technical skills I’m proud to present.

## About the Project

This portfolio was created to share my development journey and give a look into my skills as a Data Engineer. It features interactive elements, responsive design, and an emphasis on clean, efficient code.

## Inspiration & Acknowledgments

The source code and structure of this portfolio draw inspiration from resources, tutorials, and open-source projects available online. I adapted elements to suit my needs, striving to keep the code clear and maintainable. A special thanks to the developers and designers who have shared their knowledge and work, helping others to learn and grow.
